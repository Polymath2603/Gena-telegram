# Privacy Policy
- This Privacy Policy applies to this application and its AI chatbot services across all supported platforms, including Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Telegram.
## Data We Collect
### The chatbot may collect and store:
- Messages and interactions sent by users, which may include personal or sensitive information
- User preferences used to personalize responses
- We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data, but messages may contain such information if provided by the user.
## How We Use Data
### Collected data is used to:
- Provide and operate the chatbot functionality
- Personalize responses and maintain conversation context
- Improve service quality and performance
## Data Storage
- Chat messages and preferences are stored securely to support application features and continuity. Some data may also be retained in backups or logs for operational purposes.
## Data Sharing
- User data is not sold or shared with third parties, except as required by law or as necessary to operate the chatbot (e.g., messaging platform servers).
## Data Deletion
- Users may request deletion of their data at any time. Upon request, active data associated with the user will be removed from primary systems. Some data may remain in backups or logs until those systems are purged.
## Sensitive Data
- Users should be aware that messages may contain personal or sensitive information. The chatbot does not attempt to read or misuse this data, but users should avoid sharing highly sensitive information unless necessary.
## Third-Party Platforms
When using third-party platforms (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Telegram), the chatbot’s data handling is also subject to the platform’s own privacy policies.
